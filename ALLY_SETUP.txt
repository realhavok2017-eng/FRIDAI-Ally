FRIDAI ROG Ally Setup
=====================

1. Copy this entire FRIDAI_Ally folder to your ROG Ally

2. On the Ally, create the settings folder:
   C:\Users\[YourUsername]\AppData\Roaming\FRIDAI\

3. Create settings.json in that folder with:
{
  "BackendUrl": "http://192.168.0.230:5000",
  "ContinuousListening": true,
  "VADThreshold": 0.005,
  "VADSilenceMs": 2500
}

4. Make sure your main PC is running the FRIDAI backend
   (python app.py should be running)

5. Run FRIDAI.exe on the Ally

Both devices connect to the same FRIDAI brain!
Same conversation, same tools, same memories.

NETWORK NOTE:
- Main PC IP: 192.168.0.230
- Both devices must be on same network
- Windows Firewall may need port 5000 allowed
